This alert is raised when the number of writes in a database index exceeds the number of reads. The following query can help identify indexes that may be candidates for adjustment or elimination:


SELECT  OBJECT_NAME(s.object_id), i.name, i.type_desc

FROM    sys.dm_db_index_usage_stats s WITH ( NOLOCK )

AND s.object_id = i.object_id

WHERE   OBJECTPROPERTY(s.[object_id], 'IsUserTable') = 1

AND s.database_id = DB_ID()

AND s.user_updates > ( s.user_seeks + s.user_scans + s.user_lookups )

AND s.index_id > 1
